Out of the 19 checks outlined in Durre et al. (2010), 10 have been completed, as seen in the table below. 

Notes:
1.	Due to the original project goals, checks which may have been completed for temperature/precipitation may not have been completed for snow
2.	The code was originally designed to work with crmp.objs, as created by Faron Anslow and James Hiebert
